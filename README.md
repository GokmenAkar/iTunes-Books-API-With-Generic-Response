### How did you decide to use that design and architectural patterns? 

* I prefer the MVVM pattern on my projects. It provides clean code, easy to use, and test. 
For ___Network Layer___ I decided to write it my own without any third party. It's suitable for MVVM and It can adapt easily if the project grows.

### What should be the part of this app that needs more time to develop or improve?

* UI could be better, but I focused more on functioning of the app. 
* Could have filter (like musicVideo, movie etc.) 

### Does this app ready to submit to store? If not, what should be done to achieve that?

* No, the app needs more UI improvements and functionalities.

### What are the things you think are missing or open in this assignment? / Do you have any comments to us?

* It may not be about the assignment but I didn't understand at first sight the search functionality will be part of the app, I thought just 100 items will be placed via API. Then I thought It would be better to add. 

### Does your project require any particular tool to be able to run?

* No
